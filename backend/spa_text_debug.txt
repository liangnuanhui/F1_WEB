The track was redeveloped in 1979, and although the new circuit is only half the original's length, it’s still the longest on the current calendar at 7.004km.When was its first Grand Prix?Chevron UpChevron DropdownHaving hosted a non-championship Grand Prix as long ago as 1924, Belgium’s iconic circuit was one of just seven to be part of Formula 1’s maiden championship in 1950. That race was won by the legendary Juan Manuel Fangio, who led home an Alfa Romeo one-two ahead of team mate Nino Farina.What’s the circuit like?Chevron UpChevron DropdownSpa is among Formula 1 drivers’ most loved tracks, with its mix of long straights and challenging fast corners allowing them to push their cars to the edge of their capabilities – if it’s dry, that is. The size of the track and the nature of Belgian weather means it can sometimes be raining on one part of the track and dry on another, meaning grip can vary from one corner to the next. Keep an eye on the thrilling Eau Rouge, arguably the most famous sequence of corners in the world, as the drivers flick left, right and then up the hill through Raidillon.Why go?Chevron UpChevron DropdownWhat’s not to love about one of Europe’s classic tracks? Only the truly great drivers conquer Spa, with Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher among those to master this magical circuit. Add in the wonderful setting of the Ardennes forest and it’s no surprise that it’s a fan favourite.Where is the best place to watch?Chevron UpChevron DropdownThe elevated grandstand located near Eau Rouge gives you the best view of the iconic corner, while also boasting panoramic views from La Source through to Raidillon. But if you fancy taking in some of the best trackside atmosphere, then the grandstand located on the Pouhon corner should be right up your street.Related VideosPlay5:53Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: What caused Russell's car to be underweight? | WorkdayPlay8:59Top 10 Onboard Moments: 2024 Belgian Grand PrixPlay0:332024 Belgian Grand Prix: Piastri passes Russell and Perez in two lapsPlay0:202024 Belgian Grand Prix: Piastri misses his marks on last pit stopPlay1:032024 Belgian Grand Prix: Listen in to the chat from the top three drivers in the cool-down room after the racePlay2:182024 Belgian Grand Prix: Watch the last lap in full as Russell holds off Hamilton to cross the line in P1Play0:42‘We just risked it’ – Wolff explains Russell’s strategy gamble at SpaRelated ArticlesView AllF1 FantasyWin tour of McLaren’s Technology Centre with F1 FantasyUnlockedJim Clark's wet weather masterclass in BelgiumFrom memorable debuts to unexpected victories – Jordan Grand Prix’s 10 greatest momentsF1 announces Formula 1 Promoter Awards winnersMoët & Chandon returns as the Official Champagne of Formula 1UnlockedF1 QUIZ: Spa-Francorchamps special – Test your knowledge of Grand Prix history at the historic Belgian trackOUR PARTNERSView allDownload the Official F1 AppLatestScheduleDriversTeamsFantasy & GamingCookie PreferencesMoreF1FacebookXInstagramYouTube© 2003-2025 Formula One World Championship Limited
